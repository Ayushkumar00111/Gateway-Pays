# 💳 Gateway-Pays  
### Digital Access Platform (2024–2025)

Gateway-Pays is a digital subscription access platform designed to provide students with a focused 24-hour premium access model to academic resources.

The project simulates a secure login system, subscription purchase workflow, and automated access expiry logic.

## 📌 About The Project

One Day Power Pass is a focused access solution designed to help students make the most of their limited time.

- 24-hour full access to premium study resources
- Controlled access duration
- Structured login & purchase workflow

The goal of this project was to design a practical digital subscription model and implement the frontend logic behind time-based access control.
